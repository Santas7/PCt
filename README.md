# PCt 
PCt (private chat terminal) - a platform for transactions between companies 1 on 1. Console chat has the highest level of security, which will allow you to make any transactions in complete secrecy, safely, securely.

# How does it work?
It's quite simple, the company that offers to do the deal and discuss it -> downloads the server.py file and runs it on its own, then tells the other company, which is also involved in the deal, the ip address. After the other company needs to download main.py enter in the program the desired address and his name. That's it, you can start communicating and come to an understanding on the deal.
